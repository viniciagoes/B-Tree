# B-Tree
A B-tree visualizer made by me in a class for Data Structures and Search and Classification of data. 

## Functioning
The functioning of the program consists in:
First, typing the dregee of the tree, as in how many 
Every node will be a different ".dat" archive, inside each one:
```
N
ID1 ID2 ID3
CH1 CH2 CH3 CH4
```
Where N is the number of keys inside the node, IDs are the elements of the node, and CHs are the IDs of the child node, if there are no child nodes (leafs) the number displayed will be "-1".
